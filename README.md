# reactionrnn

reactionrnn is a Python 2/3 module + R package on top of [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras)/[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) which can easily predict the proportionate reactions (love, wow, haha, sad, angry) to a given text using a pretrained recurrent neural network.

```python
from reactionrnn import reactionrnn

react = reactionrnn()
react.predict("Happy Mother's Day from the Chicago Cubs!")
```
```
[('love', 0.9765), ('wow', 0.0235), ('haha', 0.0), ('sad', 0.0), ('angry', 0.0)]
```

Unlike traditional sentiment analysis models using tools like [word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)/[doc2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html), reactionrnn handles text at the character level, allowing it to incorporate capitalization, grammar, text length, and sarcasm in its predictions.

```
> react.predict("This is scary AF!ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±")
[('wow', 0.9109), ('sad', 0.0891), ('love', 0.0), ('haha', 0.0), ('angry', 0.0)]
```

```
> react.predict("When the soup is too hot ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚")
[('haha', 0.8568), ('love', 0.1376), ('wow', 0.0056), ('sad', 0.0), ('angry', 0.0)]
```

```
> react.predict("He was only 41.")
[('sad', 1.0), ('love', 0.0), ('wow', 0.0), ('haha', 0.0), ('angry', 0.0)]
```

```
> react.predict("Everyone loves autoplaying videos!")
[('angry', 0.8667), ('wow', 0.1333), ('love', 0.0), ('haha', 0.0), ('sad', 0.0)]
```

As a bonus, the model can encode text as a 256D vector (incorporating grammar/caps/length/punc) which can then be fed into other machine learning/deep learning models.

```
> react.encode("DYING. ðŸ˜„")
[ 0.0411452   0.87985831  0.31406021, ...]
```

Did I mention that reactionrnn is also available as an R package with feature parity?

```
library(reactionrnn)
react <- reactionrnn()
react %>% predict("Happy Mother's Day from the Chicago Cubs!")
```

```
      love        wow       haha        sad      angry 
0.97649449 0.02350551 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000 
```

## Usage

For Python, reactionrnn can be installed [from pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reactionrnn) via `pip`:

```
sudo pip3 install reactionrnn
```

For R, you can install reactionrnn from this GitHub repo with devtools (working on resolving issues to get package on CRAN):

```
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("minimaxir/reactionrnn", subdir="R-package")
```

You can view a demo of common features in [this Jupyter Notebook](/docs/reactionrnn-demo-python.ipynb) for Python, and [this R Notebook](http://minimaxir.com/notebooks/reactionrnn/) for R. (full documentation coming soon)

## Neural Network Architecture and Implementation

![](/docs/model_shapes.png)

reactionrnn is based off of the June 2016 blog post I wrote titled [Classifying the Emotions of Facebook Posts Using Reactions Data](http://minimaxir.com/2016/06/interactive-reactions/), which noted that there is a certain nuance to the proportionality of the reactions on a Facebook status. What makes a Facebook post "WOW" but *not* "HAHA"? Is there a semantic difference between a post with 75% SAD and 90% SAD? A year later, Facebook now has enough public data to sufficiently train a neural network to understand these nuances.

reactionrnn takes in an input of up to 140 characters (for compatability with Twitter tweets), converts each character to a 100D character embedding vector, and feeds those into a 256-cell [gated recurrent unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit) layer. That output regresses the five non-Like Reactions all simultaneously and outputs the predicted proportionality values for each; predicted values will always sum to 1 (unlike Google's [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com), the output is **not** the probability of the label as is the case with a classification model!)

The 1.3MB model weights included with the package are trained on the captions on hundreds of thousands of public Facebook statuses on Facebook Pages ([via my Facebook Page Post Scraper](https://github.com/minimaxir/facebook-page-post-scraper)), from a very *diverse* variety of subreddits/Pages (which is necessary since some Pages will have *very* different reactions to a given text!). The network was also trained in such a way that the `rnn` layer is decontextualized in order to both improve training performance and mitigate authorial and temporal biases toward given reactions.

The `encode` function of reactionrnn returns the intermediate 256D output from the 'rnn' layer.


## Notes

* Keep in mind that the network is trained on modern (2016-2017) language. As a result, inputting rhetorical/ironic statements will often yield love/wow responses and not sad/angry. 

* If a text sequence is >140 characters, reactionrnn will only use the first 140 characters.

* If you do use `encode` on multiple texts, I strongly recommend using [principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) to both reduce the high dimensionality of the text (i.e to 30-50D) and align the returned encoded texts. (see reactionrnn demos on how to implement PCA in Python and R)

* A GPU is not required to use reactionrnn.

## Future Plans for textgenrnn

* A web-based implementation using Keras.js (works especially well due to the network's small size)

* A larger pretrained network which can accommodate longer character sequences and a more indepth understanding of language, creating better/more robust reaction predictions. This may be released as a commercial product instead, if any venture capitalists are interested.
